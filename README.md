# SEB-R Course Deliverables

A **Deliverable** is an assignment that is required to be submitted and reviewed by your instructional team.  Although not all labs/homework are required to be submitted as deliverables, they are still to be completed when assigned since they provide the necessary practice for the lessons taught.

Graduation requires that 80% of deliverables be completed and delivered on time.

Deliverables not submitted during the unit they are assigned will not be accepted.

All submitted deliverables must "work" and meet the minimum requirements outlined by your instructional team - they are graded as complete/incomplete.
