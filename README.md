# Deliverables# SEIR Deliverables

A **Deliverable** is an assignment that is required to be submitted.  Although not all labs/homework are required to be submitted as deliverables, they are still to be completed when assigned since they provide the necessary practice for the lessons taught.

Graduation requires that 80% of deliverables be completed and delivered on time.

Deliverables not submitted during the Unit they are assigned will not be accepted.

All submitted deliverables must "work" and meet the minimum requirements - they are graded as pass/no-pass.
